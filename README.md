✨ rs485-library
----------------
This library is used for Modbus-RTU protocol based on RS485.

I create it when test [DYDW-004](
http://www.dyloadcell.com/product/dwlcgq/97.html), a 3-axis force sensor.
Theoretically, this library may suitable for other RS485 devices, since it
regulate a serial port communication following Modbus-RTU protocol.
